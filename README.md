This project aims to implement the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for data classification. KNN is a simple yet effective machine learning method that can be applied to various tasks such as image classification and price prediction.

Project Goal:

The primary goal of this project is to understand and implement the KNN algorithm and apply it to a real-world classification problem.

Tasks:

Data Loading and Preparation: Load and prepare the dataset that will be used for classification.
KNN Algorithm Implementation: Implement the KNN algorithm in Python.
Algorithm Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the KNN algorithm for different values of the K parameter.
Visualization of Results: Visualize the classification results using visualizations.
Requirements:

Python 3.6 or later
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Instructions:

Clone the project repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Load the data and run the Python scripts.
Analyze the results and draw conclusions.
